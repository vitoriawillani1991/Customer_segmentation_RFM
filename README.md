# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation project based on the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model. This project aims to provide valuable insights into your customer base by utilizing Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value to segment your customers into distinct groups. Understanding customer behavior and preferences can help you tailor your marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and boost your company's overall success.

### Recency (R) <a name="recency-r"></a>

Recency evaluates how recently a customer has interacted with your company. Customers who have made a more recent purchase or interaction receive a higher Recency score, while those who haven't engaged with your company in a long time receive a lower score.

### Frequency (F) <a name="frequency-f"></a>

Frequency measures how often a customer makes purchases or interacts with your company. Customers who purchase or engage more frequently receive a higher Frequency score.

### Monetary Value (M) <a name="monetary-value-m"></a>

Monetary Value evaluates the monetary worth of a customer's purchases. Customers who spend more receive a higher Monetary Value score.

## Customer Segmentation

Based on the RFM values, customers can be divided into different segments. For example, customers with high Recency, high Frequency, and high Monetary Value scores are considered the most valuable, while those with low scores in all three categories may be considered inactive.

Recency is often used to identify customers who may be inactive or on the verge of churning. Targeted marketing actions can then be taken to re-engage these customers, such as sending special offers to inactive customers who made a purchase a long time ago.

## Customer Segmentation Clusters

At the conclusion of this project, customers have been classified into the following six clusters:

1. **Possible Churn Clients**
2. **Excellent Recency and Good Frequency Clients**
3. **Most Frequent Clients**
4. **Excellent Frequency and Great Recency Clients**
5. **Regular Clients**
6. **Highest Monetary Clients**
